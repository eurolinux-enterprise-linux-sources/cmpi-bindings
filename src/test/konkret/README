This directory contains test to reproduce an upcall hang in Pegasus. To
try, install KonkretCMPI 0.8.7. Build this provider with "make". Use the
.reg files to register with pegasus. Copy library into place. Then run the
upcall provider as follows:

    $ cimcli ei KC_Upcall

This hangs in the _references() test.
